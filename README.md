## An "ultra slim" JavaScript MVVM library

This is an "ultra slim" library for JavaScript UIs that follows (loosely) the model-view-viewmodel architecture (MVVM). It was started as an evaluation of a minimalistic alternative to frameworks such as Angular.io. At present, it provides: 

- Routing
- Templating
- Model bindings 
- REST clients for model data
- IndexedDB as drop-in for REST clients when used offline

(... more an code coming soon)
